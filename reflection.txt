## Reflection questions

1. Which of the Swing tutorial pages did you find the most interesting and/or
   helpful while implementing your graphical application?

   Answer:The slider tutorial pages were the most interesting but using the EventListener tutorials
   and learning how to respond to specific user interactions was the most helpful.

2. Are you aware of any areas where your submission is not working as intended?
   If so, describe the issue and what you did to try to diagnose it.  Otherwise,
   describe how you verified that your submission fulfilled its requirements.

   Answer: We went through the submission requirements and made sure that our program matched all
   the required expectations.

3. Did you embellish your program in any way?  If so, describe your changes /
   improvements.

   Answer: Yes, to further explore the features of JLabel, we decided that we wanted
   the Score Label to have some color. We used a Hue, Saturation, and Brightness picker to get the color we wanted.
